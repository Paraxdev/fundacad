//! Native 3Dconnexion SpaceMouse reader.
//!
//! Tauri's Linux webview (WebKitGTK) has no WebHID, so the page can't read the
//! device itself. We read its HID reports here in a background thread and
//! forward 6DOF motion + button state to the frontend via Tauri events
//! (`spacemouse:motion`, `spacemouse:button`); the frontend maps them onto the
//! camera + actions.
//!
//! Linux permissions: hidapi opens the `/dev/hidrawN` node, so the udev rule
//! MUST target `SUBSYSTEM=="hidraw"` — a `SUBSYSTEM=="usb"` rule changes the usb
//! node, not hidraw, and will NOT grant access. See `packaging/99-spacemouse.rules`:
//!   KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="046d", MODE="0660", GROUP="input", TAG+="uaccess"
//!   KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="256f", MODE="0660", GROUP="input", TAG+="uaccess"
//! Install: copy to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`, then
//! `sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger`, then replug. If
//! `spacenavd` or the 3Dconnexion driver is running it may already hold the
//! device — stop it to let FundaCAD read it directly.
//!
//! Set FUNDACAD_SPACEMOUSE_DEBUG=1 to log raw reports for tuning (the old
//! SINDRICAD_ spelling still works).
