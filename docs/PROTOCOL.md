# Sidecar wire protocol

The frontend and the Python geometry sidecar (`sidecar/server.py`) talk JSON over one
persistent WebSocket, `ws://127.0.0.1:8765`. It is a request/response protocol: every
request carries a client-generated `id`; every terminal reply echoes that `id`. There is
one connection per app instance; concurrent calls are matched by `id`, not by ordering.

This document describes the wire shapes as implemented in `sidecar/server.py` (the
dispatch in `handle()`) and consumed in `src/geometry/client.ts`. If the two ever
disagree, the code is the source of truth - update this file to match it, not the other
way around.

## Connecting

The URL carries the per-launch shared secret as a query parameter:

```
ws://127.0.0.1:8765/?token=<SINDRI_SIDECAR_TOKEN>
```

The Rust shell mints `SINDRI_SIDECAR_TOKEN` per launch and hands it to the frontend via
the `sidecar_token` Tauri command; the frontend fetches it once in `Geometry.init()`
before opening the socket. A connection missing or misquoting the token, or one whose
`Origin` header isn't the Tauri webview / dev server, is closed with WebSocket close
code 1008. There is no unauthenticated mode.

## Request envelope

```jsonc
{ "id": "<client-generated string, e.g. a UUID>", "op": "<op name>", /* op-specific fields */ }
```

## Reply envelope

A **terminal** reply always has the same top-level shape:

```jsonc
// success
{ "id": "<matching id>", "ok": true, "result": { /* op-specific */ } }
// failure
{ "id": "<matching id>", "ok": false, "error": { "message": "...", "feature_id": "..." /* optional */ } }
```

`rebuild` and `computeAll` additionally stream **non-terminal progress frames** with no
`ok` field - see "Progress frames" below; a client must not resolve a pending call on
one of those.

## Ops

### `rebuild`

Rebuilds the document and returns tessellated geometry. Supports two request shapes:

**Full send** (first call, or after a resync):
```jsonc
{ "op": "rebuild", "id": "...", "document": { /* CadDocument */ }, "revision": 1,
  "tolerance": 0.1, "known": { "<bodyId>": "<etag>", ... } }
```

**Delta send** (the sidecar worker already holds a document from a prior full send):
```jsonc
{ "op": "rebuild", "id": "...", "baseRevision": 1, "revision": 2,
  "ops": {
    "length": 5,               // truncate/pad the held feature list to this length
    "set": [[2, { /* feature */ }], ...],  // [index, feature] pairs that changed
    "parameters": { /* optional, only when changed */ },
    "bodyVisibility": { /* optional, only when changed */ }
  },
  "tolerance": 0.1, "known": { "<bodyId>": "<etag>", ... } }
```

`tolerance` defaults to `0.1` server-side if omitted. `known` maps body id -> the etag
of the mesh payload the client already holds, for the per-body cache described below.

Reply `result` is one of:

- **Resync needed** - the worker doesn't hold a document at `baseRevision` (first
  connection, worker respawn, or a missed message): `{ "resync": true }`. The client
  must retry with a full send.
- **Nothing built yet** (e.g. only sketches, no solid): `{ "protocol": 2, "bodies": [], "bbox": null }`.
- **Built** (protocol v2, per-body payloads - see below):
  ```jsonc
  {
    "protocol": 2,
    "bodies": [ /* one entry per live body, full payload or "unchanged" stub */ ],
    "bbox": { "min": [x,y,z], "max": [x,y,z] },
    "diagnostics": [ /* selector resolutions worth reporting; see below */ ],
    "datumPlanes": { "<datumPlane id>": { "origin": [..], "normal": [..], "xdir": [..] } },
    "sketchPlanes": { "<sketch id>":     { "origin": [..], "normal": [..], "xdir": [..] } },
    "featureError": { "message": "...", "feature_id": "..." },   // optional
    "featureErrors": [ { "message": "...", "feature_id": "..." }, ... ]  // optional
  }
  ```

  `datumPlanes` and `sketchPlanes` say where the build actually PUT each plane, for
  features anchored to a body face. The feature's own `plane` is the cache written at
  pick time, and once the face moves the two part company, so a client that draws from
  the cache draws the sketch at the old position while the geometry cut from it lands
  at the new one. `datumPlanes` carries every datum and has its `offset` already
  applied; `sketchPlanes` carries only the sketches that MOVED, so an absent id means
  the cache is still right. Both are display state and are never written back into the
  document.
  `featureError`/`featureErrors` are present only when one or more features failed and
  were recorded as no-ops; the geometry that *did* build is still returned (a failing
  feature never blanks the whole model). `featureError` is the most-downstream failure,
  for a single-line banner; `featureErrors` carries all of them.

  `diagnostics` is omitted when empty, but when present it is **complete for the whole
  document** — an incrementally-resumed rebuild replays the diagnostics of its cached
  prefix rather than reporting only the features it re-ran. Clients may rely on that:
  the "Re-pick face" repair is offered only when the build carries a repairable entry,
  so a partial array would silently withdraw a repair path on exactly the documents
  that need it. (Before 0.1.70 the array *was* partial — a resumed build re-reported
  every error with zero diagnostics.)

  A diagnostic may carry a machine-readable **`code`** beside its human `reason`:
  `ambiguousReference` (the selector matched several candidates), `referenceNotFound`
  (it matched nothing) and `planeTilted` (a face-anchored plane's face is no longer
  parallel, so the plane kept its cached placement). Adding a code is a pure addition —
  an unrecognised one must read as "unclassified" — and the prose match on `ambiguous
  nearest pick` is still honoured, so a sidecar older than the field keeps its repair
  affordance. The first two are repairable by picking a face; `planeTilted` is not,
  because the candidate filter is taken against the cached normal and re-picking the
  same tilted face reproduces the same diagnostic.
- **Fatal** - nothing built at all: `{ "error": { "message": "...", "feature_id": "..." } }`.
- **Stalled worker** - one operation ran past the stall timeout (60 s of no build
  progress): the sidecar kills and respawns the geometry worker and returns
  `{ "error": { "message": "one operation stalled for over N s - the geometry kernel was restarted; progress up to the last checkpoint is kept" } }`.
- **Crashed worker**: `{ "error": { "message": "the geometry kernel crashed on this operation" } }`.

#### Per-body payload (protocol v2)

Each entry in `bodies` is either an **unchanged stub**:
```jsonc
{ "id": "b1", "name": "Body1", "etag": "3f9a...", "unchanged": true }
```
or a **full payload**, when the client's `known` etag for that body is stale or absent:
```jsonc
{
  "id": "b1", "name": "Body1", "etag": "3f9a...",
  "positions": [ /* flat float array, xyz per vertex */ ],
  "indices": [ /* flat triangle index array */ ],
  "faceIds": [ /* per-triangle face id, local to this body */ ],
  "faceOwners": [ /* per-face owner id or null, for feature highlighting */ ],
  "edges": [ { "points": [...], "body": "b1" }, ... ],
  "faceCount": 12
}
```
The client (`Geometry.assemble()` in `src/geometry/client.ts`) keeps the last full
payload per body id and merges stubs + full payloads into one flat mesh (vertex/index/
faceId offsets rebased per body), reproducing the pre-v2 single-mesh `RebuildReply`
shape for the rest of the app. If a stub's etag doesn't match anything the client is
holding (e.g. state lost across a worker respawn), `assemble()` returns `null` and the
client resyncs with one full request.

### `computeAll`

MCAD-style "Compute All": bypasses every cache layer (the sidecar's RAM prefix cache,
mesh cache, and disk checkpoints/blobs) before doing one cold full rebuild. Always a
full send, never a delta:

```jsonc
{ "op": "computeAll", "id": "...", "document": { /* CadDocument */ }, "revision": 2, "tolerance": 0.1 }
```

Reply shape is identical to `rebuild`'s built/fatal cases above (protocol v2, no
resync case since this is always a full send). Streams the same progress frames.

### `export`

Rebuilds (from the warm in-worker cache, not a cold rebuild) and writes one file.

```jsonc
{ "op": "export", "id": "...", "document": { /* CadDocument */ }, "format": "step" | "stl" | "3mf",
  "path": "/abs/path/out.step", "body": "<bodyId>", "separate": false }
```

`body` (export just one body) and `separate` (write every body to its own
`<base>-<name>.<ext>`) are optional. Reply:

```jsonc
{ "path": "/abs/path/out.step" }                 // default / single-body
{ "path": "...", "paths": ["...", "..."] }       // separate
{ "path": "...", "warnings": [{ "message": "...", "feature_id": "..." }] }  // some features failed but others built
```

Export is "export what built": a feature failure never blocks exporting the bodies that
did build; only zero live bodies is a hard `{ "error": {...} }`.

### `exportProject`

Rebuilds and writes an OrcaSlicer-format project 3MF (one object per body, palette slot
-> extruder mapping), via `sidecar/project3mf.py`.

```jsonc
{ "op": "exportProject", "id": "...", "document": { /* CadDocument */ },
  "path": "/abs/path/out.3mf",
  "palette": [ { "name": "...", "color": "#rrggbb", "material": "..." } ],
  "bodyColors": { "<bodyId>": 0 },
  "bodyNames": { "<bodyId>": "Bracket" },
  "settings": { /* written into the 3MF verbatim, capped at 256 KiB JSON */ } }
```

`palette`/`bodyColors`/`bodyNames`/`settings` are all optional (default to empty).
`settings` failing the size/type check replies `{ "error": { "message": "exportProject: bad settings" } }`
before any rebuild runs. Otherwise the reply matches `export`'s shape (`path` +
optional `warnings`).

### `interference`

Pairwise interference (clash) check among the document's live bodies.

```jsonc
{ "op": "interference", "id": "...", "document": { /* CadDocument */ } }
```

Reply:
```jsonc
{ "pairs": [
  { "a": "<bodyId>", "b": "<bodyId>", "aName": "...", "bName": "...",
    "volume": 12.34, "bbox": { "min": [x,y,z], "max": [x,y,z] } }
] }
```
One entry per pair whose boolean intersection volume exceeds a small epsilon. A cheap
bounding-box reject skips most pairs before the (crashable) boolean intersection runs.

### `import`

Reads an external geometry file (STL / 3MF / STEP / BREP) into an embeddable BREP
payload for an `import` feature. Path-based - the sidecar reads the file directly, the
frontend never ships file bytes over the socket.

```jsonc
{ "op": "import", "id": "...", "path": "/abs/path/in.step", "format": "step" }
```

Reply: `{ "brep": "...", "name": "...", "solid": true, "faces": [...] }` (the exact
fields the frontend embeds as an `import` feature), or `{ "error": { "message": "..." } }`.
Given a longer budget than a normal rebuild (mesh read + B-rep build can run longer).

### `ping`

Liveness check with no side effects: `{ "op": "ping", "id": "..." }` -> `{ "pong": true }`.

### Unknown op

Any other `op` value replies `{ "error": { "message": "unknown op: <op>" } }`.

## Progress frames

During a `rebuild` or `computeAll`, the sidecar sends interim frames on the same
connection, reusing the request's `id` but with **no `ok` field**:

```jsonc
{ "id": "<same id as the request>", "status": "building", "feature": 3 }
```

`feature` is the index of the feature currently being built, or `-1` while
tessellating. `meshed` / `meshTotal` carry the payload phase's per-body denominator
(both `-1` outside it), so a client can say "meshing 812/3071" rather than sitting at
0% for the whole phase. These fire roughly once a second during a long rebuild. An
`import` streams the same way with `status: "importing"` and `phase` / `label` / `pct`.

A client must route **any** frame carrying a `status` string to its progress listeners
and never treat one as the terminal reply - the real `{ "ok": ... }` reply always
follows once the rebuild finishes (or the worker is judged stalled/crashed, per the
`rebuild` error cases above). Guarding on `status === "building"` alone is a trap: an
unrecognised status then falls through to the pending-request map and resolves the
caller with a frame carrying no `ok`, so the caller reports failure while the sidecar
happily keeps working.

## Binary mesh frames (`"binary": true`)

`rebuild` and `computeAll` accept `"binary": true`, which moves the per-body mesh arrays
out of the JSON header and into raw little-endian buffers appended to the same frame:

```
[u32 LE header_len][header_len bytes UTF-8 JSON header][pad to 4][buf0][buf1]...
```

The header is the normal `{"id","ok","result"}` envelope, except each mesh array
(`positions`/`normals` → f32, `indices`/`faceIds` → u32) is replaced by `{"$buf": i}`
referencing `result.$buffers[i] = {"dtype","len"}` (`len` is an **element** count) in
on-wire order; the client walks `$buffers` to compute offsets sequentially. A body's
edge polylines are packed the same way into `{"$pts","$counts","body"}`, where `$counts`
holds each edge's **point** count. Everything else - stubs, `faceOwners`, `bbox`,
`diagnostics` - stays inline JSON in the header.

Both dtypes are 4 bytes/element, so after the single header pad every buffer is
4-aligned for free. **INVARIANT: adding a wider dtype requires per-buffer padding.**

## Chunked replies (`"chunked": true`)

A successful `rebuild`/`computeAll` mesh reply can exceed any single frame the socket
will carry (`_MAX_FRAME`, 128 MiB - a DoS control, mirrored in `client.ts` as
`MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES`). `"chunked": true` (which also requires `"binary": true`) splits
the reply across several frames instead, so document size stops being a hard limit.

Each chunk is a **self-contained binary frame** in exactly the layout above - its own
header, its own pad, its own `$buffers` table. Buffer indices are therefore **frame-local**
and each chunk decodes independently. The framing rides in one extra envelope field:

```jsonc
{ "id": "<request id>",
  "stream": { "sid": "<per-reply id>", "seq": 0, "final": false },
  "status": "chunk",          // NON-final frames only
  "ok": true,                 // the FINAL frame only
  "result": { /* ... */ } }
```

- **`seq: 0` (the head)** carries every non-body field (`protocol`, `bbox`,
  `diagnostics`, `projectionUpdates`, `featureError(s)`) plus a **`manifest`**: one entry
  per body of the reply, in final order, as `{id, name, etag, nodeRef?, unchanged?}` plus
  `{faceCount, nVerts3, nIdx, nTris, nEdges, hasNormals?}` **for full bodies only**.
  Sizes are absent on stubs by design - the sidecar does not have them, because those
  arrays live in the client's own per-body cache. The head carries no `bodies`.
- **`seq: 1..N`** each carry a contiguous slice of `bodies` (plus its `$buffers`), in
  manifest order. Order is load-bearing: the client accumulates each body's global
  `faceStart` by it, and face picking keys off those ranges.
- The **final** frame carries `ok: true` and `stream.final: true` and no `status`; it is
  what resolves the request.

A client must treat the stream as complete only when `final` is set, `seq` arrived dense
from 0, and the accumulated body count equals the manifest length. The count check is
load-bearing rather than defensive: `assemble()` prunes its per-body cache to the ids it
was handed, so silently accepting a short stream would evict the missing body and corrupt
the *next* rebuild's `known` map too.

Two invariants a client may rely on, neither of them local to the sending code:

- **Streams never interleave.** `_serialized` holds its lock across the whole of
  `_dispatch`, including every send.
- **No `building` frame lands mid-stream**, even though it shares the request `id`: the
  worker has already returned before the first chunk goes out.

Chunking is **binary-only**. There is deliberately no JSON-text chunk form: a text frame
carrying `status` is routed to progress listeners and dropped.

Negotiation is per request, exactly like `binary`. An older sidecar ignores the unknown
flag and answers with one frame; an older client never sets it and gets one frame. So
neither side can emit a stream the other cannot read. When the flag *is* set, every
successful mesh reply is streamed - not just large ones - so the multi-frame path is
exercised constantly rather than for the first time on a user's oversized assembly.

Two cases still end a reply with a terminal **text** error, which supersedes any partial
stream: a cancel arriving between chunks (`{"ok": false, "cancelled": true, ...}`), and a
**single body** whose own payload exceeds the frame cap - the one case chunking cannot
fix, since a body is the indivisible unit of a chunk. That error names the offending body.

## Bad input

Malformed JSON on the socket gets `{ "id": null, "ok": false, "error": { "message": "bad JSON: ..." } }`
(no request `id` to echo). Any exception raised while handling a request is caught and
turned into `{ "id": "...", "ok": false, "error": { "message": "<exception text>" } }`
rather than dropping the connection.
