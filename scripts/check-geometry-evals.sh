# check-geometry-evals.sh — CI gate for the sidecar's geometry eval harnesses.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the evals under sidecar/tools/ are MEASUREMENT oracles. They
# print a number and exit 0 whether that number is good or catastrophic
# (eval_selector_survival is a hash-locked Norn oracle — its exit contract is
# "0 = measurement completed", and changing that would break the sealed arc).
# So nothing was gating them, and nothing ran them: between 2026-07-12 and
# 2026-07-28 the golden-document baselines went 15 commits stale and real-server
# op coverage decayed 28/28 -> 23/34 with no signal. This script supplies the
# thresholds, leaving every oracle's own contract untouched.
#
# Run from the repo root:  sh scripts/check-geometry-evals.sh

# Coverage RATCHET, not a target: real-server op coverage may never drop below
# what it is today. It is currently 33 of 33 — every unit in the universe is
# covered by an EXPLICIT check that asserts a precomputed numeric geometric
# invariant against a real spawned server.
#
# VERIFIED REACHABLE ON A CLEAN CHECKOUT: with corpus credit disabled entirely,
# coverage still read 32/32 when the floor was 32, so not one counted unit
# depends on a fixture document. That check is not optional ceremony — this
# floor was once set to 23 from a machine where two ops were credited only by a
# corpus document whose import source lived in the developer's home directory,
# and every other checkout scored 21. Re-run that way before raising this number again.
#
# Four ops are excluded in e2e_coverage.py rather than counted, because no
# numeric geometric invariant exists for them and the only way to make them
# count would be to weaken the credit gate: cancel (a race — test_cancel.py),
# listFonts and tessellateText (font-dependent, so a hardcoded constant would be
# unreachable in CI by construction — test_text.py), and cleanUp, which is
# best-effort-no-op by design and is the one ACKNOWLEDGED remaining gap.
#
# Raise this number when you cover more; never lower it to make a build pass.
# Raised 32 -> 33: patternLinear now has an explicit real-server check
# (check_pattern_linear), which was the last op without one. It is an explicit
# check against a spawned server, not corpus credit, so it is reachable on a
# clean checkout by construction.
# Raised 33 -> 34: the `inspect` op joined the universe and arrived with its own
# explicit check (check_inspect), which asserts pi*r^2*h against the B-rep
# volume — a closed form, so it needs no fixture and no tolerance argument.

# NOT WIRED YET: tools/golden_corpus.py --check.
# It self-gates (exit 1 on drift) and is the strongest detector here. Its
# baselines were re-blessed on 2026-08-05 and it now passes 13/13 locally,
# confirmed as a live detector (a +5% volume perturbation exits 1).
#
# THE BLOCKER IS NO LONGER THE BASELINES — it is that the 13 corpus documents
# are UNTRACKED. `*.sindri` is gitignored repo-wide on purpose (public repo, no
# real geometry), so on a fresh checkout every path in golden.json is missing
# and this would go red immediately. Wiring it needs SYNTHETIC .sindri documents
# committed as an explicit exception in BOTH .gitignore and
# check-repo-hygiene.sh — the same treatment the assembly STEP fixtures already
# get — with their own captured baselines. Do NOT commit the real 1-5*.sindri:
# they are actual work, and this repo is public.
#
# What was re-blessed and why: 12 of 13 documents drifted, and every new error
# was an `ambiguous face reference` refusal introduced deliberately by f58858b
# ("Refuse an ambiguous nearest-selector instead of flipping a coin", 2026-07-28)
# — 16 days AFTER the 2026-07-12 capture. Verified before re-blessing: no new
# error CLASS appeared anywhere in the corpus, and the refused picks are genuine
# exact ties (0.600 vs 0.600 mm, 0.000 vs 0.000, 5.731 vs 5.731 on 1.sindri f73,
# which is the very feature that commit was written for).
