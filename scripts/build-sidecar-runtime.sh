#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Build a self-contained, RELOCATABLE Python runtime for the SindriCAD geometry
# sidecar, for bundling into the app (Tauri bundle.resources). Used by local bundle
# builds and CI. Bash covers Linux + macOS; the CI Windows leg runs the equivalent uv
# commands in PowerShell.
#
# Output layout (default: src-tauri/sidecar-runtime/):
#   sidecar-runtime/
#     python/              a python-build-standalone interpreter, copied in whole
#                          (relocatable by design) with the locked deps installed
#     app/                 the sidecar *.py sources (server.py, builder.py, ...)
# Launch:  <runtime>/python/bin/python3.12 <runtime>/app/server.py   (cwd=<runtime>/app)
#
# Two things this gets right that a naive `uv pip install build123d` does not:
#   1. LOCKED versions. The sidecar is a uv project (sidecar/pyproject.toml + uv.lock);
#      the code is written against those exact pins (build123d 0.10.0, cadquery-ocp
#      7.8.1.1.post1, ...). Installing latest breaks it. We install the exported lock.
#   2. COPIED interpreter, not a symlink to uv's managed python, so the tree ships.
#
# VTK is removed (novtk): the sidecar's used surface never imports it (proven by the
# smoke suite with vtk blocked), and it is ~341 MB.
