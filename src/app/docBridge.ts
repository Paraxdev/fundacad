 *  reference-equality staleness check on sketch features; and the delta wire
 *  protocol diffs features by object identity, so a proxy would make projection
 *  refreshes silently stop shipping. The document stays raw and authoritative;
 *  components observe a version counter instead.
 *
 *  One subscription per channel, installed once at engine construction — never
 *  per component. Emit is a synchronous unbatched fan-out, so N component
 *  subscriptions would mean N synchronous callbacks per edit; one counter bump
 *  is O(1) and Vue's scheduler batches the resulting effects. */
