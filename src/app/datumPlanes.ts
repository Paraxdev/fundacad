   *  a datum that follows a face that is a cache, and it goes stale the moment
   *  anything upstream of the face moves: the sketches on the datum are placed by
   *  the sidecar, which re-resolves the face, while the quad drawn here would
   *  still be at the pick-time position. Two planes, one name.
   *
   *  So the last rebuild's answer wins when there is one. It arrives with the
   *  offset already applied, and that is backed out rather than used directly so
   *  the offset stays a LOCAL edit: dragging a plane's offset moves the quad on
   *  the same frame instead of waiting for a rebuild, which is the property this
   *  whole function was written for. Backing it out is exact, since an offset
   *  runs along the plane's own normal and does not turn it. */
