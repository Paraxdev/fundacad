 *  · ONE material shared by every ghost, recreated on each mount rather than
 *    cached: a ghost hangs off a body mesh and disposeBody's traversal disposes
 *    whatever it finds on the way down, so a rebuild that replaced one body has
 *    already disposed the material every OTHER body's ghost is wearing.
