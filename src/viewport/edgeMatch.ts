 *  STRAIGHT edge is sampled as just its two endpoints (tessellate._line_endpoints),
 *  so `floor(2/2)` returned the END POINT, and the sidecar's nearest-edge
 *  resolution then measured from a CORNER: on a 20×20×35 box, clicking a 35mm
 *  vertical edge stored its top corner and resolved to a 20mm TOP edge, whose
 *  centre is nearer. Picking one edge and filleting another was the visible
 *  symptom.
 *
 *  Every site that builds or matches a selector must use this one function, or
