// face, then fillet it", where the face is shorthand for every edge around it.
//
// It has to be geometry, because there is no topology to ask. The rebuild reply
// carries faces (as triangles tagged with a face id) and edges (as polylines)
// side by side and says nothing at all about which edges bound which face; the
// sidecar's own edge->face map (tessellate.edge_polylines_by_body) is used to
// drop coplanar seams and never crosses the wire. So an edge belongs to a face
// when it LIES on it: every sample of its polyline sits on the face's surface.
//
// DOM/three-free, so vitest covers it headlessly — same discipline as
// edgeMatch.ts next door, and for the same reason: this is the part that can be
// wrong in a way the user sees (filleting the wrong ring of edges), while the
// buffer walking that feeds it needs a real model to exist at all.
