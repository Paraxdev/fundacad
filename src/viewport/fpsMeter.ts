// and nothing is dirty, no frame is drawn at all. A naive counter would then sit
// at "0 fps" on a perfectly healthy idle app, so this reports `idle` instead —
// which also makes the render-on-demand behaviour visible rather than looking
// like a stall.
//
// The number that actually matters when something feels slow is the frame TIME,
// not the rate: a rate is capped by the display's refresh, so it reads 60 right
// up until it falls off a cliff, while the millisecond figure degrades smoothly
// and is directly comparable to a budget (16.7ms at 60Hz).
