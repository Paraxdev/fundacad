// How much of the model ONE edge pick means, when that pick is about to become a
// fillet or a chamfer.
//
// A blend cannot terminate mid-tangency, so picking an edge normally drags its
// whole tangent chain into the operation (see edgeFeatureTool.tangentChain, and
// the note above it for why OCCT leaves no choice). That is right for the case
// it was written for — the rim of a plate, where "this edge" plainly means the
// rim — and wrong for the case that kept coming up: a user zoomed hard into one
// corner, who means that corner and gets the entire perimeter of the part.
//
// So a pick carries a SCOPE now, decided here, from two things the user has
// already told us without being asked:
//
//   SHIFT — held while picking, it means "exactly what I clicked". It is an
//   explicit instruction, so it beats everything else, and it is additive:
//   shift-clicking edge after edge builds the member set one edge at a time.
//
//   ZOOM — how close the camera is on the thing being picked. Nobody flies in to
//   fill the screen with one corner and then means the whole rim. This is a
//   guess, so it is only ever the DEFAULT: every member stays click-toggleable
//   inside the tool, either way.
//
// Both zoom readings are deliberately RATIOS. An absolute world distance ("the
// camera is within 20mm") would mean something different on a 6mm cube than on a
// 400mm plate, and the same part modelled in inches would decide differently
// from the same part modelled in mm. A ratio is the same number at every scale —
// which is also what makes it something a test can pin down.
//
// Lives in the viewport layer, not with the edge tool, for the same reason
// edgeMatch.ts does: it is about the camera, the pick and the selection, all of
// which the viewport owns, and the viewport records the answer alongside the
// edge selection it belongs to. Kept DOM/three-free so vitest covers it with no
// canvas, camera or WebGL context — the pointer plumbing on both sides of it
// cannot run headless, and this is the part that decides what the user gets.
