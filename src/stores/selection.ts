 *  This was a module-level `let selectedFeature` in main.ts, pushed imperatively
 *  into three panels by selectFeature(). It has to be reactive now because the
 *  inspector renders from it; the engine keeps `engine.selectedFeature` working
 *  as an accessor over this, so the ~10 non-Vue readers are unchanged.
 *
 *  Note this is FEATURE selection only. Face/edge/body selection still lives in
 *  the Viewport, which is why the browser tree pulls it through predicates at
 *  render time rather than being handed it. */
