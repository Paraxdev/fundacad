 *
 *  This replaces the class's `seenNodes` seeding, which added a key to the
 *  collapsed set the first time it was rendered. Seeding is a WRITE, and the
 *  panel's node list is now a computed — writing reactive state from inside a
 *  computed is exactly the kind of thing that loops or drops updates. Deriving
 *  the default from the key's namespace and recording only the user's own
 *  toggles is the same observable behaviour with no write during render.
 *
 *  The namespacing is not cosmetic either: assembly node labels come from a STEP
 *  file, so two subassemblies sharing a product name would otherwise collapse as
 *  one, and a product named "Bodies" would collide with a built-in folder. */
