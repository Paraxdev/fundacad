/** The two projected badge layers over the sketch: editable dimension labels and
 *  constraint glyphs.
 *
 *  SPLIT OF RESPONSIBILITY, and it is the whole reason this store looks the way
 *  it does: everything here is STRUCTURE — which badges exist, what each says,
 *  which classes it wears, which one the Delete key is armed on. POSITION is not
 *  here and must never be. Both layers project every badge from sketch mm to
 *  screen px on each frame the camera moves; a 200-label sketch at 60 fps is
 *  12,000 style writes a second, and routing those through Vue's scheduler would
 *  be a performance disaster. The components collect their elements into a plain
 *  (non-reactive, non-ref) array and write `style.transform` directly from a rAF
 *  loop — see Sketch{Dim,Glyph}Layer.vue.
 *
 *  shallowRef throughout, and markRaw on everything that lands here: the items
 *  carry commit/placeCommit/onDelete closures over SketchMode and the raw
 *  document, the anchors are THREE.Vector2s a drag mutates IN PLACE, and the
 *  plane and viewport are Three.js objects. None of it may become a Proxy. */
