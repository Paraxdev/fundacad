// The single inventory of what each modeling tool can ACT ON: the kinds of
// entity a tool consumes, and — read the other way — which tools a given
// selection is actually able to feed.
//
// Same shape as document/numFields.ts, and for the same reason. That file is the
// one place that knows which numeric fields a feature carries; this is the one
// place that knows which entities a tool takes. Before it, the answer was spread
// across four unrelated readers that each re-derived it from scratch: the
// selection handle's ranking in app/viewportWiring.ts, the enable/disable rules
// in the context menus, the "select a face first" refusals inside each starter,
// and the tools themselves. They disagreed — a face selection offered Press/Pull
// and nothing else, while Fillet, which can perfectly well round every edge of
// that face, was reachable only by re-picking the edges by hand.
//
// Two directions, one table:
//
//   consumedKinds("fillet")      -> what can this tool consume?
//   applicableTools({face: 1})   -> given this selection, which tools apply?
//
// It is a capability model, not a dispatcher: it says a face selection COULD
// feed Fillet, never how Fillet gets from a face to the edges it blends (that is
// edgeFeatureTool's job) and never whether the document is in a state where the
// command would succeed. Keeping it to the one claim is what lets every caller
// trust it.

 *
 *  "vertex" is here ahead of its picker: nothing in the viewport selects a
 *  corner yet, so no tool declares it and `toolsConsuming("vertex")` is

 *  entirely — Shell can act on a face, but a selected face does not make Shell
 *  runnable without a further click. Only "selection" tools can answer
 *  applicableTools(), which is the distinction the ambient affordances need and
