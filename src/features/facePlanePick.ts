// "Which plane did I just click?" — one answer, shared by everything that turns
// a face into a plane: cross-section mode aiming its cut, and the datum-plane
// tool creating one you can sketch on.
//
// It is the thin impure shell around planeMath: the raycast, the face's
// triangles, and the rebuild-stable selector that lets the pick be STORED. The
// arithmetic itself (which plane a flat face implies, where a round one's
// tangent plane lands) lives next door where vitest can reach it.
//
// The selector matters as much as the plane. A datum plane that merely froze the
// numbers would stop following the face it was made from the moment anything
// upstream moved — which is the whole difference between a construction plane
// and a note about where a face used to be.
