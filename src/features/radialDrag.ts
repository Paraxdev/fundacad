// Grabbing a cylinder used to translate it, which is the one thing a cylindrical
// face cannot do — it has no single direction to move along, and the average of
// its facet normals is zero. What a shaft or a hole actually has is a size, so
// that is what the handle scrubs. The reading is a diameter rather than a radius
// because a diameter is what a drawing, a drill and a caliper all say.

// Split from pressPullTool.ts on the house rule: the tool is pointer plumbing
// that cannot run headless, and these are the functions that can be wrong in a
// way a user notices.
