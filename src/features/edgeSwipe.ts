// How far a fillet/chamfer drag has gone, measured against the EDGE.
//
// The gesture is "swipe away from the edge": how far you are from it is the
// radius or the setback, and which side you are on picks which of the two. The
// measurement therefore has to be the cursor's distance from the edge, and
// nothing else. It was the cursor's travel along a 3D axis instead
// (manipulator.axisDragDistance), which is right for press/pull — there the
// face really does move along a world direction and the projection IS the
// answer — and wrong here, because a radius is a size rather than a
// translation, and there is no world direction it is a distance along.
//
// The symptom was the axis's own degenerate case. When an axis leans toward the
// camera there is nothing left to project onto, so that function falls back to
// the cursor's VERTICAL screen position, and the drag stops asking how far you
// are from the edge and starts asking how near the top of the window you are.
// On a rim seen close to edge-on that is most of the gesture. Measuring in the
// screen plane against the edge's own projected direction has no such case: an
// edge that projects to a point is the one degeneracy, and there every
// direction is genuinely "away from the edge", which is exactly what the
// fallback below does.
//
// Pixels in, pixels out. The caller scales by pixelWorldSize at the anchor, the
// same conversion the manipulator has always used at its own degeneracy.
