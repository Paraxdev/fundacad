 *  hit-testing and the projection around it need a real canvas and a real
 *  camera, which vitest does not have.
 *
 *  The anchor is the mean of the ARC-LENGTH midpoints, matching where
 *  EdgeFeatureTool anchors the same selection — the handle must not shift when
 *  the tool takes over. The tangent comes from the FIRST usable edge: with
 *  several edges there is no single right perpendicular, and one that at least
 *  lies across a real member reads better than the camera-right fallback.
 *  A null tangent means "no usable direction" and leaves that fallback to the
 *  caller, which is the only party that knows where the camera is. */
