// How large a blend the geometry AROUND an edge can actually hold.
//
// The drag was previously bounded by one number for the whole document: a
// quarter of the model's bounding-box diagonal (edgeDragMath.MAX_DIAGONAL_
// FRACTION). That is a crude stand-in for the real constraint, and it is wrong
// in both directions at once:
//
//   too generous — a 100x100x2 plate has a 141mm diagonal, so the drag would
//   happily reach a 35mm fillet on a 2mm rim. Every value past 1mm is a dead
//   certainty of failure, and the user spends the drag watching a preview that
//   cannot build. This is the "sometimes it overshoots" half.
//
//   too tight — on a chunky part the same fraction stops well short of a fillet
//   the kernel would have built without complaint, and the number simply refuses
//   to grow. This is the "sensible fillets are denied" half.
//
// The constraint is LOCAL: a blend fails when it runs out of face to sit on,
// which is decided by what is near THIS edge, not by how big the part is. So
// measure that instead — the distance from the edge to the nearest bit of the
// body that is not attached to it.
//
// Measured against EDGES rather than faces, and that is a deliberate
// approximation. The sidecar has the real thing (tools/gen_fillet_corpus.py
// `_clearance`, edge-to-nearest-non-touching-FACE via BRepExtrema) but it lives
// behind a round-trip, and this number is needed the instant the selection
// changes and must not stall a drag. The viewport already holds every edge as a
// polyline, in memory, exactly. The two measures agree on the cases that decide
// the bound anyway: a face's distance from an edge is realised somewhere on that
// face, and on the geometry that actually constrains a blend — a thin wall, a
// narrow rib, a shallow pocket — that somewhere is at or very near the face's
// own boundary, which is an edge. Where they differ, this reads SMALLER (a face
// can approach closer in its interior than its rim does), and erring small is
// the safe direction for a bound.
//
// Kept free of THREE and of the DOM so vitest can reach it with no viewport,
// camera or WebGL context — same reason edgeDragMath.ts and pickScope.ts are
// split out. This is arithmetic that is either right or quietly ruins the
// gesture, so it belongs where a test can pin it down.
