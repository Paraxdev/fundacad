// quietly wrong: deciding WHICH of a feature's selectors the sidecar was
// complaining about.
//
// The sidecar reports the failing selector by its own stored POINT (ResolveDiag
// `at`), not by an index, because a selector's position in the feature is not
// stable across the sidecar's own grouping (see _group_sels_by_body). Matching
// on the point is what keeps the two sides from having to agree on an ordering.

// into a rotated basis and move everything downstream). So re-picking the tilted

/** The repairable-reference diagnostic for a feature, if this build reported one.

 *  "Repairable" means the user can fix it by picking a face, which is broader
 *  than ambiguity: a sketch or datum plane anchored to a face FALLS BACK to its
 *  cached plane rather than failing the build, and says why — the face is gone,
 *  or the reference no longer names exactly one face. Both are answered by the
 *  same gesture, so both get the same button. Without them the "Re-pick the
 *  face" prose the sidecar writes would have nothing behind it.
 *
 *  `at` is still required: it is the stored selector point, and without it
 *  findSelectorAt cannot say WHICH selector to swap.
 *
 *  The prose fallback is DELIBERATE and stays. Matching `reason === "ambiguous
 *  nearest pick"` across the language boundary is what this used to do, so a
 *  sidecar older than the `code` field — most commonly server.py run by hand
 *  from another checkout, which is a routine workflow here — would otherwise
 *  lose the Re-pick affordance with nothing to explain it. */
