// The handle that appears the moment you select something you could pull.
//
// Selecting used to be a dead end: the entity lit up and you were expected to
// know that some command — Fillet, Chamfer, Press/Pull — would consume the
// selection. This puts the offer on screen instead: a handle standing off the
// thing you just pointed at, saying "pull me".
//
// It is deliberately NOT a tool:
//
//  - it does not set toolBusy(), because a passive affordance that blocked
//    every other command would be a modal state the user never entered. You can
//    select something and then do literally anything else.
//  - it does not touch suspendPicking, so normal selection keeps working
//    around it.
//  - it owns no value, no preview and no document state. Grabbing it hands the
//    gesture to the real tool, which owns all of that already; this file's
//    entire job is to be visible and to be grabbable.
//
// One class serves every entity type, because the handle is the whole point:
// pressing it arms a tool that mounts its OWN handle at the same anchor inside
// the same pointerdown, and if the two are not literally the same glyph on the
// same axis the handover is a visible jump that steers the drag somewhere the
// user did not aim. Keeping edges and faces on one implementation is what makes
// that guarantee cheap to hold. What differs between them — where the handle
// stands, which way it points, which tool takes over — arrives as a placement.
//
// Per-frame work stays out of Vue: the transform is written straight onto the
// Three.js object in a rAF loop, the same way the tool gizmos do it.
