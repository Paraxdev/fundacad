// The mirror of edgeNudge.ts: same arrow, same loop (selectionNudge.ts), same
// one-press gesture — pointed along the face normal and handing over to
// PressPullTool instead of EdgeFeatureTool.
//
// The anchor and the normal come from viewport.selectedFacesForPressPull(),
// which is the SAME call PressPullTool.start() makes off the same selection.
// That is not laziness, it is the correctness argument: the tool arms inside
// the pointerdown that grabbed this handle, and if the two derived their
// geometry independently the arrow would jump the instant the user committed to
// the drag. One source, no divergence possible.

 *
 *  On a round face the arrow points AWAY FROM THE AXIS rather than along the
 *  face normal, because the drag it arms is a resize. Away from the axis on a
 *  bore as well as a boss: pulling the handle outward means a bigger hole and a
 *  bigger shaft alike, and the difference between them is a sign the tool
 *  applies on the way to the kernel, not a direction the user has to think
