/** An uncontrolled input whose value tracks a source EXCEPT while it has focus.
 *
 *  Replaces liveInputs.ts's `keystrokeGuard`. Vue solves half the problem: keyed
 *  patching stops the element being destroyed and recreated, but a `:value` binding
 *  still re-fires when the document changes and clobbers uncommitted keystrokes just
 *  as thoroughly. Parameter commits are queued on a promise chain and land
 *  asynchronously, so this is not hypothetical.
 *
 *  Focus is the right guard HERE (unlike in keystrokeGuard, whose comment warns
 *  focus alone is wrong) because the scope is one input rather than a whole panel:
 *  if this field has focus the user is editing this value, and the incoming update
 *  is by definition staler than what they typed. */
