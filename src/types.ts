// LINE OPERAND IDS: a field that names a *line* (`line`, `l1`, `l2`) accepts
// either a plain entity id, or the compound form `"<rectangleId>~<k>"` naming
// one edge of a rectangle — k = 0..3 in rectCorners CCW order (bl→br, br→tr,
// tr→tl, tl→bl). The solver registers those 4 implicit edges already
// (sketchSolve's rectangle branch), so a rect edge is a first-class line
// operand for distance/angle/perpendicular-distance dims. Note the asymmetry:
// the constraint that NAMES such an edge is still an ordinary user constraint
// with the ordinary `k<i>` solver id — only the operand id contains `~`
// (`constraintIndexOf` decodes any `~` id to null, which is why the implicit
// ids can never be blamed for a conflict). Anything that validates a line
// operand must decode the compound form; in the sketcher that is
// entityDims.lineOperand and SketchMode.pruneConstraints.
//
// LABEL PLACEMENT: a dimension's label position is user-adjustable — dragging a
// label in the sketch persists where it went. Placement is stored in sketch MM
// as an offset from the dim's own natural anchor, and it lives in ONE of two
// places depending on which renderer owns the label:
//
//   * constraint-rendered dims (p2pDistance/p2lDistance/radius/angle and the rim
//     family radialGap/c2cDistance/c2lDistance/p2cDistance) carry `place` on the
//     CONSTRAINT — set by the dimension tool's placement click or by a label
//     drag, honoured by entityDims.constraintDims.
//   * badge dims (rectangle W/H, circle diameter, polygon radius, slot L/W, line
//     length) have no backing constraint in the general case — a circle shows a
//     diameter badge whether or not a `diameter` constraint exists — so their
//     placement lives on the ENTITY, in `dimPlace`, keyed by DimField, and is
//     honoured by entityDims(). (That's why `distance`/`diameter` constraints
//     still carry no `place`: their label is the entity's badge.)
//
// What the offset MEANS is per dimension kind, and each renderer documents its
// own rule: free 2D for a circle diameter (the vector sets the diameter line's
// angle AND the label's distance along it), perpendicular-only for the linear
// dims, radial-only for a polygon radius.

  // comparison in sketchSolve, exactly as it holds an annulus from inverting.
