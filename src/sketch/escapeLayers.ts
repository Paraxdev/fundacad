// What ONE press of Escape means inside a sketch.
//
// Escape in a sketcher is a stack, not a command: it undoes the most local thing
// you are in the middle of, and only when there is nothing local left does it
// leave. Collapsing that into a single answer is the classic way to lose work —
// an Escape that closes the sketch out from under a half-drawn rectangle throws
// the rectangle away AND the session with it, and the user pressed one key.
//
// The ORDER is the whole content of this file, so it lives here as data rather
// than as the shape of an if-chain buried in a 3900-line class: each rung is one
// named thing the user can be in the middle of, most local first. sketchMode.ts
// reads its own state into the record below and does what it is told, which is
// also what lets vitest pin the order down without a canvas, a camera or a
// document (the split features/edgeDragMath.ts makes for the edge gesture).

 *  the objects themselves: the decision is about WHETHER something is in flight,
