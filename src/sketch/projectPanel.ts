// Selection-filter chips for the sketch Project tool: a small floating bar shown
// while the tool is active (TextPanel's floating-DOM style — there is no shared
// FloatingPanel widget, and the Sketch Palette is a persistent checkbox list,
// the wrong shape for a mutually-exclusive mode set).
//
// This is now a FACADE over stores/toolPanels.ts +
// components/overlays/ProjectFilterBar.vue. `filter` stays a plain property
// because sketchMode.ts:3119/3151/3185 read it SYNCHRONOUSLY, inside the
// projection routine — it is tool state that happens to have chips, not panel
// state, so it lives in the store and survives hide()/show().
