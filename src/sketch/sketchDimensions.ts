// Persistent, editable dimension annotations on committed sketch geometry. Each
// label is projected onto the geometry; click it to type a new value in the current
// display unit. This is the "edit the length later" half — the live W/H boxes handle
// creation. The dimension set comes from entityDims(), shared with the value rows
// and SketchMode.editDimension.
//
// Now a FACADE: the labels are rendered by components/overlays/SketchDimLayer.vue
// out of stores/sketchAnnotations.ts, and the drag, value editor and per-frame
// reprojection live there (the last deliberately outside reactivity). What stays is
// exactly the surface SketchMode already talks to, so sketchMode.ts did not move a
// line.
