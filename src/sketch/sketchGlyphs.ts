// On-canvas constraint glyphs: small badges projected onto the sketch, mirroring
// SketchDimensions. Each shows a constraint's type; clicking one (in the select
// tool) deletes that constraint. Conflicting constraints render red.
//
// This is now a FACADE. The badges are rendered by
// components/overlays/SketchGlyphLayer.vue out of stores/sketchAnnotations.ts;
// what stays here is the shape SketchMode already talks to — same constructor,
// same show/hide/setInteractive, same onDelete/onOverlapPick hook fields — so
// sketchMode.ts (3,781 lines, zero HTML) did not have to move a line.
//
// The projection loop that used to live at the bottom of this file went to the
// component, NOT to reactivity: 200 badges re-projected on every camera frame
// are style writes, not state. See the component and the store for the split.
