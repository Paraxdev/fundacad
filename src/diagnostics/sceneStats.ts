// have answered itself: how many triangles is it drawing, how big is the canvas,
// what pixel ratio, what did the renderer report, what was the frame rate. None
// of it was in the report, so all of it had to be re-measured by hand.
//
// Deliberately cheap and total-only. It reads counters the viewport already
// keeps; it must never traverse geometry, because a report is filed when things
// are already going badly.
