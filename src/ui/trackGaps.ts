// "which gap is the cursor in" is exactly the kind of thing that is silently
// wrong on the axis nobody tested: comparing x against a stacked column puts
// every chip's midpoint at the same coordinate, so the marker always lands in
// gap 0 and the model rolls back to nothing.
//
// Rects in, index out — no DOM. happy-dom implements no layout, so measurement
// code is normally e2e territory; this is the half of it that need not be.
