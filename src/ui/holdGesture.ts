// The press-and-hold gesture behind the tool rail's variant flyouts, as a state
// machine with no DOM in it.
//
// Every rail button carries two meanings on the same pointer: press and let go
// and you run the tool that is on the face; press and KEEP HOLDING and the
// flyout of variants opens instead, and the tool you release over becomes both
// the thing that runs and the button's new face. Those two readings of one
// press are decided entirely by timing and by where the pointer comes up, which
// is exactly the kind of rule that is obvious while you are writing it and
// impossible to reason about three changes later — so it lives here as a pure
// transition function rather than as a scatter of booleans across a component.
//
// The failure this shape prevents is the one that makes a rail feel broken: a
// hold that ALSO runs the default when you let go, so opening the Rectangle
// flyout draws a rectangle you did not ask for. In this machine that cannot
// happen, because opening leaves the `pressing` phase and only `pressing`
// produces runDefault.
//
// Nothing here reads a clock. The component owns the timer and sends `hold`
// when it fires; that keeps the whole rule set synchronous and testable, and it
// means a timer that outlives its press (the classic source of a menu that pops
// open a second after you clicked) is just an event arriving in a phase that
// ignores it.

/** How long the pointer must stay down before the flyout opens, in ms.
 *
 *  Long enough that an ordinary click — press, release, roughly 80-150ms — can
 *  never trip it, short enough that holding on purpose does not feel like the
 *  app has stopped responding. The touch convention is ~500ms, which is tuned
 *  for accidental contact with a screen; a deliberate press on a mouse needs
