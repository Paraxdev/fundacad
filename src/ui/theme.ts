// The active theme, as a user setting.
//
// A theme here is a palette and nothing else — the proportions (radii, the
// spacing scale, easing, durations) are shared across all of them, so switching
// is a repaint and never a relayout. The palettes themselves live in
// styles/_themes.scss; this file only decides which one is on, remembers it, and
// tells anyone who has to react.
//
// Deliberately the same shape as ui/iconPacks (registry, narrow-an-untrusted-id,
// localStorage, listener set): the two settings behave identically from the
// user's side, and a second mechanism for the same job is a second thing to keep
// in step.
//
// The DOM side is one attribute. CSS does the rest, because a theme block is the
// same custom properties at a higher specificity — which also means the app is
// already themed before this module runs, and a failure here degrades to the
// default palette rather than to an unstyled page.
