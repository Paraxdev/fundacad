// The app's own log — every error, warning and notice, kept whole.
//
// It exists because the places an error currently surfaces all shorten it. A
// toast is one line with `text-overflow: ellipsis`, and the title bar's status
// pill is narrower still, so a sentence like "Fillet failed on Body1: Failed
// creating a chamfer, try a smaller length value(s)" arrives as "Fillet failed
// on Body1: Failed cr...". The part that got cut is the part that says what to
// do about it — and for a geometry kernel that sentence is often the only
// diagnosis anyone is going to get.
//
// So messages land here in full, and nothing here ever truncates. The panel
// wraps text rather than clipping it, and can copy an entry verbatim, because
// the realistic next step after reading a kernel error is pasting it somewhere.
//
// Module-level rather than a Pinia store, and the same shape as ui/theme.ts and
// ui/icons.ts: a value, a validating gate on the way in, and a listener set.
// That is deliberate — logging has to work from places that have no component
// and no active pinia (a window error handler, a worker callback, module
// initialisation), and a store would make the earliest and most interesting
// failures the ones it could not record.
