// The one sanctioned v-html in the app.

// It is safe for a reason that has to hold for it to stay safe: every value in
// icons.ts's pack tables is a compile-time string constant in that file. No
// document data, no file name, no network payload ever reaches it. Nothing else
// may use v-html — see the CI grep.
//
// Renders the <svg> element ITSELF rather than wrapping one, because the layout
// rules select `.ribbon-btn svg` / `.ctx-item svg` directly and a wrapper span
// would sit between them and break the flex sizing.
//
// `size` goes on as width/height ATTRIBUTES, never as an inline style. That is
// what lets a stylesheet keep the last word: `.ribbon-btn svg { width: 24px }`
// beats a presentation attribute, so the ribbon stays sized by CSS while the
// dozens of call sites with no rule of their own get the size they asked for.
// An inline style would silently invert that and shrink the ribbon.
//
// `data-icon` is the only thing a test or an e2e script can assert on now that
// these marks are paths rather than characters: `.tree-eye` used to be read
// through textContent, and an <svg> has no text content at all.
