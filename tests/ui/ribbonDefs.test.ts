// Worth pinning because these tables are edited to REGROUP, not just to add:
// three rectangles and three circles were folded into split buttons so the
// sketch CREATE group stopped being fourteen buttons wide. A fold moves an
// action from a top-level item into a `children` array, and the two ways that
// goes wrong are both silent. Drop one and the tool is gone from the ribbon AND
// from the command palette, which builds its list from these same tables.
// Duplicate one and the palette offers it twice while the split button that owns
// it can be left showing a tool another button also runs.
