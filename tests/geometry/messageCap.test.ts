// GH #4, "Release build cannot open files larger than 245 MB".
//
// The sidecar's websockets server answers any frame past `max_size` with a 1009
// close instead of an error reply. That took the whole session down rather than
// one operation: the oversized body stays in the document, so every following
// rebuild re-sent it and re-killed the socket, and the only thing the user was
// shown was "geometry engine connection lost" — which points at the connection,
// not at the file they just opened.
//
// The client therefore has to refuse the payload BEFORE sending it. This pins
// the boundary and, more importantly, that the message names the real limit:
// the reporter explicitly asked for "a clear error explaining the limit".
