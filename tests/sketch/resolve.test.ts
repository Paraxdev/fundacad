// Regression lock for the Wave-1 pattern-baking fix (docs/IMPROVEMENT-AUDIT.md
// §1.2 / §5.2): SketchMode.enter() must resolve ONLY a sketch's real (persisted)
// entities — never the pattern-derived copies — or else every enter/finish cycle
// bakes the previous cycle's derived copies in as new real entities and the
// sketch grows without bound. These tests exercise the resolve.ts round trip
// that enter()/finish() rely on: resolveRealEntities -> toSketchEntity -> (next
// cycle) resolveRealEntities again.
