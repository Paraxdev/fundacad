// Orbiting about a point that is not the orbit target.
//
// camera-controls always aims the camera at its target, so the point it turns
// about is the one at the centre of the screen. A pan moves that target with the
// camera and an orthographic zoom-to-cursor trucks both toward the cursor, so
// after a couple of ordinary gestures it sits well off the model and orbiting
// swings the model through an arc the size of that offset. Measured in a
// browser on a 40x30x20 box: one 380px pan put the target 61mm from a model of
// radius 27mm, and the next orbit took half the model off the top of the screen.
//
// The correction is a rigid translation applied after the library's own
// rotation. What has to hold is the identity it rests on, which is what this
// file pins: rotate-about-target-then-shift IS rotate-about-pivot, for every
// point, which is the only reason the shift can be a single vector rather than
// something that depends on what is being looked at.
