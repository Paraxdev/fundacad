// The fillet/chamfer drag measures the cursor against the EDGE.
//
// It used to measure travel along a 3D axis, which is right for press/pull and
// wrong here: a radius is a size, not a translation, so there is no world
// direction it is a distance along. The axis measurement also had a degenerate
// case — an axis leaning toward the camera has nothing left to project onto, so
// it fell back to the cursor's vertical screen position, and on a rim seen
// near edge-on the drag stopped asking how far you were from the edge and
// started asking how near the top of the window you were.
//
// These are the properties that failure violated, which is why they are the
// ones pinned: the value depends only on distance FROM THE EDGE LINE, sliding
// along the edge changes nothing, and the sign is the side the arrow points to.
