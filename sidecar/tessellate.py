"""B-rep -> render payload: mesh (positions + indices + per-triangle faceIds),
edge polylines, and bounding box.

Meshing runs through OpenCASCADE's **BRepMesh in parallel** — one call meshes the
whole solid's faces across the OCCT thread pool in C++ (no Python GIL, scales to
every core; see occt_smp.py). We then read each face's triangulation back and tag
every triangle with its face index, which gives the frontend clean `faceIds` (one
clicked triangle -> its whole CAD face) and a natural seam for per-face normals.

(The previous implementation called build123d's `face.tessellate()` in a serial
Python loop — single-threaded and GIL-bound. On a 6-sphere union @0.01mm that was
~670ms; the parallel path below is ~85ms on a 5900X.)

def _list_shapes(lst):
    """Elements of an OCP shape list WITHOUT draining its Python iterator.

    Exhausting a pybind11-bound OCCT collection costs ~101us of FIXED cost when
    StopIteration fires, independent of length (measured on a 2-element
    TopTools_ListOfShape: iter + 2 next() = 0.9us, the third next() = 101us),
    while Extent() is 0.18us and First()/Last() together are 0.55us.

    edge_polylines_by_body used to drain each edge's ancestor list TWICE — once
    for the coplanar test, once for the seam test — so ~202us of every edge went
    on iterator teardown, dwarfing the ~1us to emit a straight line or ~82us to
    sample a circle. Almost every edge has one or two adjacent faces, so the
    drain now happens only in the non-manifold >2 case, which no shape in the
    fixtures produces at all. Measured on a cold open of the 356 MiB reference
    assembly: that pass went 85.7 s -> 7.7 s (11.1x), taking the whole cold open
    from 298 s to 220 s. Output is byte-identical — same 348,580 polylines, same
    1,726,523 points — which is why this needs no CODE_VERSION bump: the cached
    mesh artifacts stay valid, so the warm reopen path is untouched.

    First() on an EMPTY list raises Standard_NoSuchObject, and an edge with no
    adjacent face is reachable (a free wire on a compound body), so the count is
    checked before either accessor is touched. Returns a tuple, so callers can
    iterate it as many times as they like for free.

    builder.py keeps its own copy of this; tessellate deliberately does not
    import builder, which would drag build123d's whole import graph in here."""

    """Sample each body's edges as polylines tagged with the body id (so the frontend
    can hide a hidden body's WIREFRAME). Two classes of edge are NOT real and are
    dropped (MCAD-style), so a part reads the way it would in any other CAD:

      * edges between two COPLANAR planar faces — a boolean's leftover seam, which
        would otherwise draw a line across a merged face;
      * the UV SEAM of a closed periodic face. A cylinder/cone/sphere/torus wraps
        onto itself, and OCCT records that closure as a real topological edge at
        u = 0 = 2pi. It is pure parametrisation bookkeeping: no tangent break, no
        crease, nothing a printer reproduces. Drawn, it put a vertical line down
        the side of every plain cylinder. The coplanar test above cannot catch it,
        because a seam has ONE face listed twice rather than two faces.

    One pass over the edge->face map: both tests and sampling together.
    Display-only; touches no geometry (can't hang).
