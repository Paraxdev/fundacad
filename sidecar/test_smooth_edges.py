"""Blending an edge that is already smooth.

The report: a block with rounded corners, one top edge picked, a 1.768mm
chamfer refused with OCCT's "Failed creating a chamfer, try a smaller length
value(s)". Smaller values were tried. They fail too — measured, the operation
fails identically at 5mm and at 0.05mm.

The cause is not size. A fillet or a chamfer cuts across the corner between two
faces, and the picked edge was the boundary of a round, where the two faces
meet TANGENTIALLY. Measured dihedral: 90 degrees on a plain box edge, 0.00 on
that one. There is no corner there, so there is nothing to cut at any size.

That makes OCCT's message not merely unhelpful but wrong: it describes a size
problem, so it sends the user into a retry loop that cannot terminate. These
tests hold the honest refusal, and — just as important — hold that ordinary
corners are still allowed, because a guard like this fails silently by refusing
everything.
