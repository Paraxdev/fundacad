"""The durable geometry blob store: content-addressed BREP, one file per hash.

This directory is the SEAM between Rust and Python. Rust writes it when opening
a `.funda` container (extracting the archive's geometry); the sidecar writes it
at import time, when it first produces a shape's bytes. Both read it.

That works without any locking because **the path is a pure function of the
content hash**: two writers racing on the same hash are writing byte-identical
data, and each publishes via rename. It is also why this store has no index —
unlike `geomstore`, whose SQLite index is documented single-process-only, and
which is exactly the wrong place to put a container's geometry: `geomstore`
lives in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`, its `evict()` reclaims any blob with a refcount of 0,
and its `purge()` is wired to the Compute All button. A blob there would be
deleted by a user pressing a button. This store is under app-data, which nothing
sweeps.

THE HASH RULE (load-bearing, not style). Hash the STORED bytes ONCE, at the
moment they are produced, and carry that hash. Never re-derive one by
re-serialising a shape: `write(read(x)) != x` byte-wise for BREP, because reading
rebuilds the shape graph in a different but equivalent order. A re-derived hash
would change every generation, so every lookup would miss and the planned
instancing/dedup work would never fire. `put_bytes` returns the hash it computed
over exactly the bytes it stored — use that return value.

Deliberately OCP-FREE. `geomstore` imports `OCP.BinTools` at module level, which
is why it can only be touched from a worker; this module is pure bytes so it can
be used from anywhere, including the sidecar's parent process.
