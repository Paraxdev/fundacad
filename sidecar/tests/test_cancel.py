"""Cancel: can a user actually stop a long-running geometry op?

Before this there was no user-facing abort anywhere in server.py or client.ts.
That was survivable only because every op was bounded by a short timeout — but
Phase B raises the import cap, and a 356 MiB STEP read holds the worker for
100+ seconds. Without cancel, one mis-click freezes all geometry with no exit.

Two things have to be true, and neither is obvious from the code:

 1. A cancel sent WHILE a job runs must be HEARD. The old read loop awaited each
    op inline (`async for raw in ws: ... await _run(...)`), so a cancel frame sat
    unread in the socket buffer until the very job it was meant to stop had
    finished. This is the reason the request loop was restructured.

 2. The cancelled op must report CANCELLED, not "the geometry kernel crashed".
    A pool job cannot be interrupted, so cancel kills the worker — which is
    indistinguishable from a segfault unless the token says otherwise.

Run:  uv run python test_cancel.py
