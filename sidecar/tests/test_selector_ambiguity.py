"""Ambiguous-selector tests (sidecar): `by:"nearest"` must refuse to guess.

Regression for the silent wrong-face bug. `by:"nearest"` used to be a bare
min() over candidates: it always returned a winner, however far away and
however close the RUNNER-UP was. On corpus doc 1, feature f73, two faces sat exactly
equidistant from the stored point; which one won flipped when an unrelated
commit perturbed topology, so a press/pull silently pushed a wall instead of the
face the user clicked, with no error at all.

The resolver now measures the margin to the runner-up (the same TIE_BAND the v2
`match` path uses) and raises on a genuine tie unless `nth` says which one is
meant.
