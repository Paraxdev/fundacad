"""A rotated rectangle builds the shape the sketch drew.

`rectangle` gained an `angle` (degrees, about its own centre) so a rectangle
drawn from three points can be SAVED as a rectangle instead of decomposed into
four lines — which would cost it its W/H dimension, its "<rectId>~k" edge
addressing and its identity in the browser tree.

The risk is a split brain. The frontend draws, picks and snaps from
src/sketch/region.ts rectCorners; the solid is built from builder._rect_corners.
If those two ever disagree the sketch extrudes into a shape nobody drew, and it
looks like a rendering bug rather than a geometry one. So the corner values are
asserted here against the same numbers the TypeScript test asserts.
