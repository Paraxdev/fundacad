"""Randomised property test for the conic profile.

Run:  uv run python test_conic_fuzz.py [cases] [seed]

The fixed cases in test_conic_blend.py check four topologies chosen because they
exercise different code paths. This checks the thing those cannot: that the
property holds on geometry nobody picked.

The property is sharp, and it is what makes this worth running rather than a
vague "does it look right":

    IF the plain fillet builds at radius r, the conic MUST build at every
    profile of r.

Because the conic is not a different operation — it is OCCT's own blend face
with one row of NURBS weights scaled. No pole moves, no knot changes, no
tangency is renegotiated. If reweighting can turn a solid OCCT accepted into one
it rejects, that is our bug, not the kernel's, and it is exactly the "a sensible
fillet got denied" complaint.

Three more invariants ride along, all falsifiable:

  monotone    more profile MOVES less material, always. The drag depends on it:
              a slider that reverses direction anywhere is unusable.
  anchored    profile 0 reproduces the plain fillet to tessellation precision.
  bounded     profile -1 never moves more than the chamfer of the same setback,
              and +1 never moves more than the fillet. Those are the geometric
              ends of the family; crossing either is an overshoot.

"Moves", not "removes", and that word is load-bearing: a blend on a CONCAVE edge
adds material instead of taking it away, so every one of these invariants would
read backwards on it. Random booleans produce concave edges freely. The plain
fillet is asked for the sign once and all three are then stated along it, which
is also the only version that is true — the family runs from the chamfer to the
sharp corner whichever way the material goes.

Cases the plain fillet already refuses are SKIPPED, not failed — that is OCCT
declining, and diagnosing it is a different job from this one. The skip rate is
reported because it is itself interesting: a high rate means the generator is
drawing radii the geometry cannot hold.

Blends the conic family does not contain (`ConicNotApplicable`) are counted
apart from both. They are not failures — the property above is about blends the
identity describes, and that exception is exactly the builder saying this one is
not among them — but they are not passes either, so they get their own line and
have to be argued about rather than absorbed. Roughly one random boolean in
thirty lands there.

    Every volume here is a difference between two INDEPENDENTLY tessellated
    solids, so it carries the mesh error of both, and the blend splits a curved
    support face and gets that face re-triangulated differently from the way the
    unblended solid had it. That error is deflection times curved area, which
    has nothing to do with the blend, while the quantity being measured is the
    blend's own volume — near profile +0.95, where the blend has all but
    vanished, the two met and the sign of the answer was the mesh's to choose (a
    1mm blend on a 9mm cylinder read as removing -0.58mm3 of material).

    Tying the deflection to the radius instead of the model keeps the ratio
    between them bounded: the error goes as defl*R*H and the blend as r^2*R, so
    at defl = r/2000 the noise is a couple of percent of the feature however
