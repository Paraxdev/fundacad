"""Checkpoint correctness tests (RAM resume + disk-checkpoint invalidation).

Run: uv run python test_checkpoint.py   (or .venv/bin/python test_checkpoint.py)

Guards the checkpointing correctness/perf pass:
  - resume-from-cache must byte-match a full rebuild (the core checkpoint invariant),
  - a resume must replay DIAGNOSTICS, not just errors, on BOTH tiers — the frontend
    gates its "Re-pick face" repair on the ambiguity diagnostic, so dropping it
    silently removes a user-facing repair path,
  - every diagnostic shape must survive json.dumps (a checkpoint write that raises
    is swallowed, which would silently disable the disk cache),
  - _body_fingerprint carries exact edge/vertex counts (catches same-volume divergence),
  - _env_sig tracks selector_tuning.json bytes (tuning edits invalidate disk checkpoints).
