"""Crease-aligned texture lattices: exactness, single-coverage, crack-freedom.

A "faceted" texture is meant to be planar facets meeting at real creases — that
is the whole reason it is the default, because a printer resolves a crease and
rounds a sub-millimetre sinusoid into mush. Sampling a height field onto a grid
only delivers that if vertices land ON the pattern's gradient breakpoints. They
did not: a uniform 4-samples-per-wavelength grid hits at most two of a
trapezoid's four corners, and the measured error reached 50% of the texture's own
depth.

These tests are the oracle for the lattice that replaces it. The exactness one is
not a smoke test — it caught a wrong derivation of _trapezoid's breakpoints (the
crest is a flat LAND, not a point, so there are four per period and not two)
that every other check in this repo passed straight through.
