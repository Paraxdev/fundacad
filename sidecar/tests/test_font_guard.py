"""Tests for font_guard.py. Run: uv run python test_font_guard.py

The bug being guarded is Windows-only in the wild (C:\\Windows\\Fonts holds font
files fontTools refuses), but the MECHANISM is portable: build123d scans a folder
at import time and one bad file aborts the whole import. So these tests build a
poisoned font folder in /tmp and prove, on this machine, that

  * build123d's own register_folder DOES raise on it (the field crash, reproduced),
  * with the guard installed it does NOT, and
  * a genuine font in the same folder still gets through.
