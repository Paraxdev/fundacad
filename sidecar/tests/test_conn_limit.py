"""A rejected connection has to give its slot back.

Every connection is counted per source IP and refused past MAX_CONNS_PER_IP.
The counter was incremented before the auth check and decremented in the
handler's `finally` — but `finally` began by cancelling the pending-task set,
and that set was only bound AFTER the auth check. So an unauthorized connection
closed the socket, returned, and raised UnboundLocalError out of its own
cleanup, which skipped the decrement below it.

The result was a sidecar that quietly bricked itself. Eight bad handshakes from
one address — a dev server started before its token was known, a page reloaded a
few times with a stale token, a client retrying — and from then on EVERY
connection from that address was refused with "too many connections", including
correct ones, for the life of the process. On the other end it looked like a
viewport that simply never built anything, with the sidecar still listening and
still logging happily.

So the property is: reject however many connections you like, and a good one
still gets in afterwards.

Run:  uv run python test_conn_limit.py
