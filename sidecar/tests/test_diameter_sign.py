"""The sign a cylindrical Press/Pull needs, pinned on the kernel side.

Dragging a round face now resizes it instead of translating it, and the drag
handle points AWAY FROM THE AXIS on a shaft and on a hole alike — pulling
outward means "bigger" either way, because that is the only reading a user does
not have to think about.

The kernel does not work in those terms. A press/pull distance moves a face
along its own outward normal, and that normal points away from the axis on a
shaft but AT the axis on a bore. So the frontend converts:

    distance = +delta on a boss,  -delta on a bore     (features/radialDrag.ts)

That conversion is a sign, and a sign that is wrong does not raise anything: the
hole you dragged open closes instead. These tests are the other half of the
seam — they assert what the kernel actually does with each sign, so the two
halves cannot drift apart silently.

Run:  python test_diameter_sign.py
