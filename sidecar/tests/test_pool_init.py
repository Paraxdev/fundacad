"""Worker-pool bring-up: telling a broken INSTALL from a crash on one shape.

Field bug 8aa9ded7 ("no bodies made", Windows 0.1.82) was a worker that could
never start. Both BrokenProcessPool handlers recycled unconditionally and said
"the geometry kernel crashed on this operation", so the replacement pool failed
identically, forever, while the user was told their model was at fault — and
the real import error was invisible, because CPython logs an initializer's
exception to the CHILD's stderr, which Windows does not inherit.

Run:  uv run python test_pool_init.py
