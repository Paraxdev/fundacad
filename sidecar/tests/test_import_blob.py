"""Tests for the import -> blob-store path. Run:
    cd sidecar && .venv/bin/python test_import_blob.py

Needs OCP (real geometry), unlike test_blobstore.py which is pure bytes.

The load-bearing test is `test_hash_is_stable_across_processes`. The whole
container design rests on carrying a content hash rather than re-deriving one,
and that is only sound if serialising a given shape is deterministic. The probe
measured that it IS deterministic for a given in-memory shape across processes,
while `write(read(x)) != x` byte-wise. This pins the half we depend on, in the
one place a future OCP upgrade could quietly break it.
