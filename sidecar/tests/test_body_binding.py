"""Body-binding tests (sidecar): fillet / chamfer / shell / draft must edit ONLY
the bodies whose geometry the user selected.

Regression for the silent wrong-body bug: these four handlers used
require_active() = bodies[-1] and carried no body reference, so on a multi-body
model a `by:"nearest"` selector best-effort-matched onto the LAST-created body
and edited it with no error at all. Selectors now carry their own `body`
(_group_sels_by_body in builder.py).
