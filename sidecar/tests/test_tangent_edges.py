"""The kernel already includes tangent edges, and this pins that.

A blend option named "include tangent edges" was about to be built: pick one
edge of a rounded outline and have the fillet follow the whole smooth run. It
turns out OCCT does that on its own — filleting ONE edge of an eight-edge
tangent rim gives byte-identical geometry to filleting all eight, while a sharp
rim does not propagate at all.

So there is nothing to add and nothing to switch off. That is worth a test rather
than a comment, for two reasons. It is the answer to a question that will be
asked again ("why is there no include-tangent-edges option?"), and it is a
behaviour the app leans on without ever asking for it: selecting one edge of a
slot outline and getting the whole outline blended is the kernel's doing, so if a
future OCCT stopped propagating, every such pick would silently start producing a
blend with a step in it, and nothing else here would notice.

The conic-profile path is checked too. That one rebuilds the solid's faces
itself (conic_blend.py) rather than calling BRepFilletAPI, so it could easily
have disagreed with the plain path, and the same pick would then cover different
edges depending on the profile value.

Run:  python test_tangent_edges.py
