"""Assembly-tree tests (Phase C).

The gate this file exists for: the document stores imported geometry as ONE
base64 BREP string, and the assembly tree is recovered by binding manifest row i
to top-level child i of that blob. That binding is only sound if a flat
compound's child COUNT and ORDER survive `_shape_to_brep_b64` ->
`_brep_b64_to_shape` unchanged. Nothing else in the repo demonstrates it: the
one real blob committed here (src-tauri/1.sindri) holds a single flat compound,
and `write(read(x)) != x` byte-wise is already a recorded property of this
format. So it is asserted here rather than assumed, across three generations,
against real STEP assemblies rather than a synthetic Compound of boxes.
