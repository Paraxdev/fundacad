"""_canonicalize's validation gate, and the paths that could bypass it.

Run: uv run python test_canonicalize.py

_canonicalize snaps near-analytic spline faces to true planes/cylinders ONCE at
import, and the result is baked into the stored B-rep. That makes its accept/
reject decision permanent and invisible: a wrong "accept" is not a slow rebuild,
it is the user's geometry quietly replaced by something else forever.

Two ways round the gate existed. SweptToElementary's output was returned
unvalidated whenever no spline face needed converting, and the multi-root import
path handed the gate a compound of compounds, whose volume it cannot measure.
