"""Stall-watchdog heartbeat coverage for the three phases that used to run silent.

Run: uv run python test_heartbeat.py   (or .venv/bin/python test_heartbeat.py)

The supervisor reaps a worker whose shared heartbeat STOPS MOVING, not one that
merely takes a long time. Export meshing, the interference pair sweep and the
per-body checkpoint write never bumped it, so each was liable to be killed for
being slow rather than for being wedged — the one distinction the stall watchdog
exists to make. It is also a hard prerequisite for moving export onto
`_run_stall`: STALL_TIMEOUT is 60 s, so supervising progress without ticks
HALVES the budget instead of lifting it.

Every check asserts the counter advances by AT LEAST the live body count.
"Non-zero" passes vacuously here, because `rebuild_cached` already emits its own
per-feature ticks — which is why the sweep check subtracts a measured warm
rebuild baseline rather than assuming the two never overlap.
