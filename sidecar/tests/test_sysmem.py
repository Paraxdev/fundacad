"""Pre-parse import gates: the RAM refusal, the three platform probes, and the
per-format file-size cap.

Run: uv run python test_sysmem.py   (or .venv/bin/python test_sysmem.py)

An OOM kill reaches the supervisor as a bare SIGKILL with no traceback, so it can
only be reported as "the geometry kernel crashed" — a geometry fault named for
what is really a machine limit. `_refuse_if_memory_is_short` exists to turn that
into a sentence the user can act on, BEFORE OCCT starts.

The platform parsers take their input as an argument precisely so all three can
be exercised here. Otherwise the macOS and Windows halves would only ever run in
front of a user, which is the same "ships untested" trap that left six suites out
of CI. The fixtures below are real captured output.
