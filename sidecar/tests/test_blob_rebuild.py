"""Tests for rebuilding an import feature FROM THE BLOB STORE. Run:
    cd sidecar && .venv/bin/python test_blob_rebuild.py

Why this suite is separate from test_import_blob.py: that one covers producing a
blob, this one covers CONSUMING it, and the consuming side has a failure mode
that only appears cold.

THE COLD-CACHE REQUIREMENT. Every op that carries a whole document goes through
`rebuild_cached`, and a warm checkpoint resolves an import WITHOUT ever touching
the blob. So a broken resolver passes on a developer's machine every time and
fails on a fresh one, after an app update, or on a wiped cache — exactly the
machines that are not ours. Every test here therefore points geomstore at an
empty directory, and `test_rebuild_is_cold` proves that isolation actually works
rather than assuming it.
