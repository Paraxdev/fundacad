"""Durable checkpoint store for the OCCT rebuild cache (design §3.2/§3.3, Phase 1).

Why this exists: rebuilding the measured 125-feature document costs ~26 s cold, but
restoring a body from a binary BREP blob costs ~14 ms — a ~1,700x lever. This module
is the disk side of that: a content-addressed blob store (ONE body per blob, keyed by
the chain key of the last feature that modified it, so an unchanged body dedups for
free — same inputs => same key => same file, no geometry hashing) plus a SQLite index
of checkpoints.

The index is SOFT STATE. Every method degrades a missing / corrupt / short entry to a
cache MISS — never an exception, never wrong geometry — so a deleted or truncated cache
only ever costs a rebuild (the `.funda` portability constraint, §1). A fresh directory
scan can always reconstruct what is restorable; the index is only there to make the
lookup O(1) instead of O(disk).

Single-process use only (the one geometry worker). SQLite's own locking is the only
concurrency control needed; there is no cross-process protocol here.
