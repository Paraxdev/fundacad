"""document -> build123d. The heart of the sidecar.

Re-runs the whole feature tree from scratch on every rebuild (no incremental
regeneration, no persistent state). build123d's algebra mode IS the parametric
engine.

The model is **multi-body**: the rebuild keeps an ordered list of named bodies
with an "active" body (the last one created/edited). Most features operate on the
active body — so a document with no body-splitting ops behaves exactly like the
old single-body code. Import adds a body; Split can produce two; Combine fuses
bodies together. The merged shape (a Compound of all bodies) is what gets
tessellated, measured and exported, so every downstream consumer stays uniform.

API notes (verified against build123d 0.11.1, dual-compatible back to 0.10.x):
  - extrude(sketch, amount=...)            free function, algebra mode
  - fillet(edges, radius=...)              radius kwarg
  - chamfer(edges, length=...)             length kwarg (NOT distance)
  - revolve(sketch, axis=..., revolution_arc=...)   degrees, default 360
  - mirror(obj, about=Plane)               about defaults to Plane.XZ
  - loft(sections)                         iterable of sketches/faces
  - split(obj, bisect_by=Plane, keep=Keep.TOP|BOTTOM|BOTH)   cut by a plane
  - Mesher().read(path) -> [Shape]         STL/3MF/OBJ -> watertight solid(s)
  - import_step(path) / import_brep(path)  native B-rep read
  - export_brep(shape, BytesIO)            serialize a body for embedding
  - a + b / a - b / a & b                  union / cut / intersect (algebra mode)
  - Plane.XY * sketch  /  Pos(x,y,z) * shape   placement via * in algebra mode
  - 0.11 makes `.wrapped` a property that ASSERTS on an empty shape (0.10 left
    the attribute simply absent) — never touch `.wrapped` directly on a shape
    that might be empty; go through `_wrapped_or_none(shape)` instead, which
    tolerates both AttributeError (0.10) and AssertionError (0.11).

    is a NO — this decides whether a rewritten surface gets baked permanently
    into the stored B-rep, so the safe answer is to keep the original.

    `deep` exists because the two halves differ in cost by two orders of
    magnitude. MEASURED across the 3,060 leaves of the reference assembly:
    the counts cost 3.5 s, `BRepCheck_Analyzer` 72 s and the volume comparison
    122 s. Running the full gate on every leaf made _canonicalize 209 s against
    the 6.9 s it costs without — 29x the entire pass it was meant to guard, and
    62% of the whole import.

    So: full gate after the sew/ShapeFix rebuild below, which re-creates faces
    from scratch and genuinely can produce an invalid or volume-shifted solid.
    Counts only after SweptToElementary alone, which is a topology-preserving
    modifier — the counts still catch gross damage, and this path previously had
    NO validation at all.

    NOTE the volume comparison is only meaningful when neither side is a compound
    of compounds: `Compound.volume` does not recurse, so on nested input it reads
    a partial figure and the gate can never pass. Callers with multi-root input
    must canonicalise per root (see import_geometry) rather than hand the whole

              the feature red but everything after it still runs; one
              permanently-failing feature must not kill the rest of the
              document).
    bodies  : ordered list of {id, name, shape} — one per live body (for per-body
              tessellation and the browser tree).

    diagnostics : optional list; when given, low-confidence selector-v2 (`by:"match"`)
              resolutions append a ResolveDiag dict to it. Resolution is best-effort
              and never fails the build on a shaky match, so callers that don't pass a
              list are completely unaffected.

    projections : optional list; when given, each sketch handler re-resolves its
              projected entities against the prefix state and appends refresh
              entries (see _recompute_projections). Steady state appends NOTHING —
              that convergence contract is what terminates the frontend's
              associative refresh loop.

    Incremental-rebuild hooks (both default off → identical to a plain full rebuild):
      resume        : (start_index, snapshot) — restore the build state captured
                      after feature[start_index-1] and run only features[start_index:].
      snapshots_out : if a list is given, append (feature_index, snapshot) after each
                      successfully-built feature, so a caller can cache per-feature
                      state and resume from the longest unchanged prefix next time.
    A snapshot copies the body dicts (sharing OCCT shape refs — no geometry copy) plus
    the sketches/datums/id-counter, and is restored by mutating those containers IN

    + bbox. A mismatch means the restore diverged and the checkpoint is treated as a
    miss. The counts are deterministic integers, so they never cause a false miss on
    OCCT float noise, and they catch a same-bbox but topologically different solid the
    box alone would wave through — measured stable across a real BREP round trip on
    400 bodies of the reference assembly.

    Every term here is chosen for cost: this runs per body inside _restore_from_disk,
    which walks 3,072 of them on that assembly (see the loop's comment for what the
    old cost did to the stall supervisor).

    - Counts come from TopExp.MapShapes_s, not build123d's `.faces()/.edges()/
      .vertices()`, which build a full list of wrapper objects just to take len() —
      measured 45x slower, and `.edges()` additionally runs a Python-level degenerate
      filter over every edge. These counts therefore INCLUDE degenerate edges, which
      is fine for a fingerprint (still deterministic) but means a value taken here is
      NOT comparable with one taken through build123d.
    - The box is BRepBndLib's poles-based one, not `shape.bounding_box()` (OCCT's
      exact AddOptimal_s): 0.080 ms/body against 67.3 ms.
    - `useTriangulation` MUST stay False. With True the box shifts by up to 0.49 mm
      once a shape carries a triangulation — 492x the 1e-3 compare tolerance — and a
      body IS tessellated when the checkpoint is written and is NEVER tessellated when
      restored, so True would false-miss intermittently and force a cold rebuild. That
      is also why `tessellate.mesh_bbox` (True by design) must not be reused here
      despite computing the same kind of box.
    - Volume is deliberately absent: 23.0 ms/body buying discrimination the counts and
      the box already provide. A blob-key collision restores either a different part
      (caught by the counts) or the same part at a different placement (caught by the

    The underlying walk is EXPENSIVE and deliberately so: `.bounding_box()` is
    OCCT's AddOptimal_s, measured at 95.5 s over the 3,072 bodies of the 356 MiB
    reference assembly. Callers that loop over every body must still tick (see
    `_interference_job`) — the memo makes the SECOND pass free, not the first.

    The obvious cheap substitute — `BRepBndLib.Add_s(..., useTriangulation=False)`,
    the poles box `_body_fingerprint` uses — was tried here and REJECTED. It is 165x
    faster and usually looser, but on that same assembly it came out up to 0.164 mm
    TIGHTER than exact on 3 of 3,072 bodies (against a 1e-6 compare tol). For a
    fingerprint that is irrelevant; for these callers a box tighter than the truth
    silently drops a real interference or a body a boolean should have touched. If
    you retry this, the property to prove is CONSERVATISM per body over the whole
    document, not average speed — a 500-body sample showed zero violations and was
    simply too small. (Its one genuine advantage: it reports empty compounds as
    void, where the exact call hands back a degenerate point-box at the origin that
    spuriously overlaps anything near it — 8 such bodies in the reference assembly.)

    Two reasons it is a tuple and not the BoundBox.

    The pair sweep is O(n^2) in PAIRS but only O(n) in distinct shapes, so
    recomputing both boxes inside the test does quadratic work for linear
    information: at 3,060 bodies that is 9,360,540 OCCT bounding-box walks
    instead of 3,060.

    And `BoundBox.min.X` is a pybind11 property that calls into OCP on EVERY
    access, up to 12 per pair. Measured over 4,680,270 pairs (3,060 bodies):

#: worker and a lost rebuild, not an error message.

#: where a freeform surface stops being offsettable depends on its own local
#: curvature, which is exactly the quantity nobody has a bound for here. Being

    target, and capping at 90% of local thickness silently stopped short.

    PLANAR faces extrude the face region into a prism and boolean it (union for +d,
    subtract for -d). This is far more robust than a local surface offset
    (BRepOffset), which SEGFAULTs on faceted / split imported faces — and it handles
    holed faces fine in practice. Every CURVED face goes through the local offset
    (_offset_faces), which is what resizes a hole, a boss or a blend cleanly.

    Curved faces used to be restricted to cylinders, which rejected work the

    Freeform surfaces stay refused, and that refusal is load-bearing rather than
    conservative: they crash. See the note on OFFSETTABLE_CURVED — a small offset
    on a BSPLINE works, which is precisely what makes a magnitude cap look
    sufficient when it is not.

    Separately, _offset_faces now validates its own result, which is a guarantee

    against the TIMELINE-PREFIX state (ctx.bodies = the bodies built before
    this sketch; the features list before it for cross-sketch sources) and
    append change entries to ctx.projections.

    Convergence contract (what terminates the frontend's refresh loop): steady
    state emits NOTHING. A fresh curve is emitted only when it differs from the
    cached one beyond _curve_close's 1e-4 tolerance, or the entity was stale
    and resolves again (stale:false clears the flag). {stale: true} is emitted
    only on the not-stale -> stale TRANSITION. Resolution here is LENIENT
    (keep-last-shape + stale flag); the strict refuse-at-pick path is
    project_geometry's.

    Multi-edge sketchCurve correspondence: a source entity yielding several
    edges (rectangle/polygon/slot) was projected as N sibling entities sharing
    source.group. The pick site persists each sibling's edge index within
    _entity_edges' deterministic order as source.index — the authoritative
    correspondence, stable across sibling deletions AND source moves. A
    multi-edge sibling WITHOUT an index is unresolvable -> stale, like an
    unknown source kind. An index beyond the fresh edge count means that
    edge is gone -> stale.

    Silhouette correspondence: a silhouette source has NO per-curve selectors —
    the source is the whole body, and the fresh HLR curve LIST can change count
    and order across rebuilds. Each group's siblings (shortlex id order) are
    matched against the fresh list in three passes, each fresh curve consumed
    at most once: (1) cached-curve match within _curve_close tolerance (steady
    state); (2) NEAREST same-kind curve by _curve_dist — endpoint + midpoint
    distance, pairs consumed in globally ascending order — so a resized
    cylinder's silhouette lines track their own side; (3) the remaining
    siblings positionally against the remaining fresh curves. Assigned curves
    are orientation-normalized to the cached endpoint order (_curve_oriented).
    Siblings beyond the fresh set go stale; fresh curves with no sibling are
    DROPPED (re-run the Project pick to pick up new outline curves — auto-add
