"""Printed surface texture: knurl/hex/waves/ribs/voronoi/noise/image height fields,
displaced into a face's triangulation at tessellation/export time.

Two-phase design (mirrors selector-v2's own resolve-lazily pattern): builder.py's
_handle_texture validates the spec against the CURRENT shape (for red-timeline
feedback) and appends the raw spec to body["_textures"] — it never touches
body["shape"]. The actual face selectors are resolved lazily, ONCE, against the
FINAL shape by resolve_body_textures() below, called from tessellate.py right
before meshing. This sidesteps every downstream-feature topology change the same
way every other selector-based feature already does (best-effort nearest-match +
diagnostic on drift, never a hard failure).

Displacement never edits the BRep (no variable-offset API in OCCT for this); it
subdivides + displaces the MESH at tessellation time. See displace_face().

    Complete lattice cells get their diagonal imposed directly, but the band
    stitching the lattice to the boundary ring is an unconstrained Delaunay: it
    maximises the minimum angle and knows nothing about the field, so where a
    crease crosses the band it can bridge straight over. scipy has no constrained
    Delaunay, so repair instead of prevent — score each triangle against the true
    field and flip a shared edge wherever that strictly reduces the error.

    Triangles touching a RING vertex are excluded from scoring. Their outer
    corners are pinned at zero displacement by the boundary taper, so they can
    never match the raw field however they are triangulated; scoring them makes
    the pass chase an unreachable target and, worse, spend its one-flip-per-pair
    budget on pairs that cannot improve, blocking neighbours that could.

    `ring_fixable` (bool mask over the first n_ring vertices) marks ring
    vertices that DO displace with the field — the UV-seam columns, which the
    taper exempts. Triangles touching only those are scored and repaired like
    interior ones: the seam strip is where a spoke crease crosses the band with
    both flanks on the ring, and skipping it leaves the crease bridged (a
