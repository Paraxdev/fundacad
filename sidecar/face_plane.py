"""The plane a picked face implies, re-derived from the B-rep at rebuild time.

A datum plane made from a face used to store the face's plane as three frozen
vectors. That is a note about where a face USED TO BE: change the box's height
and the datum stays behind, along with every sketch placed on it. Storing the
face SELECTOR instead and resolving it each rebuild is what makes it a
construction plane, and this module is the second half of that, turning a
resolved face back into {origin, normal, xdir}.

Everything here is a deliberate mirror of features/planeMath.ts, which answers
the same question in the browser at pick time. The two must agree to the digit:
the frontend's answer is cached on the feature and drawn as the datum's quad,
and this one is what sketches are actually placed on, so a disagreement is a
sketch that jumps the first time anything upstream is touched. Each rule below
names its counterpart. Kept out of builder.py because that file cannot be
imported without a geometry kernel, and these rules are worth testing without
one.

    Note the discontinuity this inherits. A face whose normal crosses the 0.9
    threshold swaps reference axes and its x direction jumps a quarter turn.

    the same jump the frontend would make on the same face; a datum on a face

    The origin sits ON the surface (axis point, then out by the radius) rather
    than at the pick, so the datum is not buried a hair inside the material. The
    x axis is the cylinder's own axis, so a sketch has "along the shaft" as its
    horizontal, which is the only in-plane frame the geometry itself supplies.

    A B-rep face's normal direction is a property of the face's orientation in
    its shell, and that can come back reversed across a rebuild without the
    geometry having moved at all: a boolean re-manufactures faces, and the
    surface a cut leaves behind is naturally oriented opposite to the one it cut
    into. Nothing about the plane's POSITION changes when that happens, but the
    datum's normal is the direction its `offset` runs along, so a silent flip
    turns "5mm above this face" into "5mm inside the part".

    The cached plane the frontend stored at pick time is the reference, since it
    is the direction the user saw and accepted. Where the plane sits is taken
    from the freshly resolved face either way, which is the whole point of
    resolving it.

    The x axis is carried across untouched, which is right for both kinds of
    plane and needs the reason spelled out because "recompute it from the new
    normal" looks equally right. A tangent plane's x axis is the cylinder's own
    axis and has nothing to do with the normal. And for a flat face,
    plane_x_dir(n) and plane_x_dir(-n) are the same vector anyway: the reference
    axis is chosen on |n.z|, which negation does not change, and
    ref - n(ref.n) is even in n. So recomputing could only differ by rounding,
    and only ever costs the cylinder its frame.
