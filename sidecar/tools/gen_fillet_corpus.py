"""Deterministic, stratified, oracle-gated fillet/chamfer eval corpus generator.

REVISION (auditor A3): the earlier bare 3x clearance floor excised the entire
failure region, saturating the corpus at 0/500. This version STRATIFIES cases into
clearance bands and replaces the clearance floor with a SEQUENTIAL FEASIBILITY
ORACLE, so tight-band-but-achievable cases (where the shipped single-call fillet
fails yet a one-edge-at-a-time application recovers) are admitted and measured.

Each case is a self-contained Neocad document: a primitive (box / cylinder) or a
simple join/cut boolean of two primitives, followed by ONE fillet or chamfer feature
(id "op") whose edges are chosen with a legacy queryable selector (axis / all /
nearest — the forms the shipping frontend actually emits; `ofFace` is NOT used, its
face argument routes through the match-fingerprint path the frontend does not emit).

CLEARANCE BAND. For every selected edge the clearance is the distance to the nearest
NON-TOUCHING face of the same body (faces at distance > EPS_TOUCH — a face sharing
the edge or an end vertex touches at 0 and is excluded), additionally capped by the
edge's own radius for a circular rim. A case's band is (min clearance) / (op size).
Cases are generated to fill fixed per-band quotas:
    [1.2, 1.5) x   quota   |  [2.0, 3.0) x   quota
    [1.5, 2.0) x   quota   |  [3.0, inf) x    quota (regression floor)
op is set AFTER measuring clearance (op = min_clearance / ratio, ratio drawn inside
the target band) so a case lands in its band by construction. Boolean templates
(join_L, cut_pocket) dominate the tight bands naturally — their thin walls give a
small clearance whose op stays individually feasible; solid box/cylinder edges have
a full-dimension clearance whose tight-band op would be individually infeasible, so
they populate the loose bands. The per-band template mix is recorded in gen stats.

FEASIBILITY ORACLE (replaces the bare clearance rule). A candidate is accepted iff
  (a) every selected edge blends INDIVIDUALLY on the pre-op body at the drawn size, and
  (b) a reference SEQUENTIAL application — one edge at a time on the evolving body,
      each subsequent edge re-identified geometrically (midpoint + direction + length)
      because prior blends renumber the topology — yields a SINGLE CLOSED VALID solid
      covering ALL selected edges, and
  (c) that sequential result removes net material (ref_removed > 0), so the evaluator's
      "removed volume > 0" and ref-volume checks are well defined.
Cases whose sequential run reaches only n-1 edges (or produces an invalid / multi-solid
body, or net-adds material) are EXCLUDED — the headline must be 100%-achievable. Each
accepted case stores applied=n (== n_edges) and ref_removed (the reference removed
volume from the sequential run) for the evaluator to score the shipped single-call
fillet against.

ANALYTIC SUBSET. A case is analytic only when it is a pure box (no boolean) whose
selected edges are convex 90-degree straight edges that do not interact at a shared
vertex — the `axis` selector's 4 disjoint full-length parallel edges, or a single
`nearest` edge. For those the removed volume is EXACT with no vertex-interaction term:
  fillet:  removed = sum (1 - pi/4) * r^2 * L_e ;  chamfer: removed = sum (1/2) d^2 L_e
The evaluator uses this exact expectation for analytic cases and ref_removed for the
rest.

CYLINDER SEAM. The cyl_axisZ (seam line) and cyl_all (both rims + seam) templates are
included because the frontend can emit those selectors, but the seam is a parametric
artifact OCCT cannot blend, so the oracle rejects those draws at generation — proving
the generator never emits a seam case even sequential can't complete. Seam discards
are logged separately.

DETERMINISM. Every draw comes from one seeded RNG; the sequential oracle uses a fixed
edge order and deterministic OCCT, so re-running a seed reproduces byte-identical
output. All stored floats are rounded to ROUND_DP so the JSON round-trips for the
self-hash (sha256 of the canonical `cases` array, recomputed and enforced by eval).

Usage (sidecar venv):
    .venv/bin/python tools/gen_fillet_corpus.py --seed 1401 --count 500 \
        --out tools/corpus_fillet.json
Frozen main corpus: seed 1401, count 500. The evaluator regenerates a FRESH HOLDOUT at
eval time with an unpublished --seed to a throwaway --out; that seed is never committed
and implementers never see the holdout (see eval_fillet_corpus.py).
