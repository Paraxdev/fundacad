"""golden_corpus.py — golden-document regression eval for the geometry sidecar.

Rebuilds real saved documents through a SPAWNED server.py subprocess and
records/compares their build invariants: body count, per-body mesh volume, the
document bbox, and the list of feature errors. A code change that silently alters
the geometry a saved document builds is caught here.

Tolerances are hardcoded literals in THIS file — no config, no env override — so
what "still matches" means can't be loosened from outside.

Usage (run from sidecar/ with .venv/bin/python):
  python tools/golden_corpus.py --capture ../src-tauri/*.funda    # append baselines
  python tools/golden_corpus.py --check                           # compare vs golden.json

--capture is APPEND-ONLY: it refuses to modify an entry that already exists.
Changing a recorded baseline requires deleting its entry from golden.json by
hand — i.e. human review.
