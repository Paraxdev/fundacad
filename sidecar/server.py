"""FundaCAD geometry sidecar — WebSocket loop + dispatch.

Protocol: one JSON request/response per message, matched by `id`.
  rebuild -> tessellated mesh (+ per-tri faceIds) + edge polylines + bbox
  export  -> writes a STEP/STL/3MF file at the given path

Heavy geometry (rebuild + tessellate) runs in a separate worker **process**, not
on the asyncio event loop. Two reasons:
  * responsiveness — the socket keeps serving (pings, other connections) while a
    rebuild runs, instead of blocking the loop on a GIL-holding OCCT call;
  * robustness — OCCT lives in another process, so a kernel crash (segfault on a
    bad boolean) can't take the server down; the pool just respawns the worker.
ONE worker (max_workers=1), for reasons that are about correctness, not CPU
saturation: features form a serial dependency chain (no second rebuild can
usefully overlap), crash isolation needs a disposable process, and we use the
'spawn' start method because fork + OCCT's threads can deadlock. Meshing still
fans out across all cores per op (occt_smp.configure), but the boolean hot path
is deliberately SERIAL per-op (builder._serial_bool — parallel BOP measured
~5x slower on many-small-tool fuses), so idle cores during a long rebuild are
expected, not a lost opportunity (audited 2026-07-25: parallel body chains /
speculative tessellation refuted — see .fable/parallelism-audit-2026-07-25.md).

Lifecycle: on Linux we ask the kernel to SIGTERM us if our parent (the Tauri
shell) dies (PR_SET_PDEATHSIG), so we never orphan. We print `LISTENING <port>`
on stdout once bound, which the Rust shell waits for before opening the webview.

    bracket from going arbitrarily fine (0.05mm floor) and a multi-metre frame

    Either way the `requested / DEFAULT` factor keeps the wire contract intact: a
    client that asks for a smaller tolerance than the default still gets a
    proportionally finer mesh for every body. Deterministic — a pure function of

    stable.

    `_run_stall` normally supervises by PROGRESS, which is the right design — but

    single atomic OCCT call that holds the GIL, so nothing inside it can bump the
    heartbeat. Supervision therefore degrades to a wall clock here, exactly as it
    already does for `import` below, and for the same reason.

    Left on the default STALL_TIMEOUT this was not a slow path but a BROKEN one:
    the 3,071-body reference assembly writes 1,031.8 MB of STEP in 69.4 s, and
    the 60 s default reaped it at 60.1 s — reporting "the geometry kernel was
    restarted" for a kernel that was working fine, and leaving NO file at the
    path the user chose. `_export_job` ticks once per body while `rebuild_cached`
    runs and then goes silent for the whole write, so the rebuild half never
    protected it.

    Scaled on the document's body count, which is what the write actually costs
    per unit: _EXPORT_SEC_PER_BODY is 4x the measured 22.6 ms/body, floored at the
    old default so a small export keeps its tight guard. Generous at the top is

    build123d/OCP import and could spend its whole budget without executing a

    the reap recycles the pool, which submits a fresh warm-up, so the retry

    The second fault is why an EMPTY document is the shape that surfaces it. The
    heartbeat's only writer is builder's per-feature tick, which fires per
    feature and per tessellated body, so a zero-feature rebuild never ticked at
    all. Nothing could reset the clock and STALL_TIMEOUT degenerated into a plain
    wall clock over queue plus execution.

    moves, so the budget measures EXECUTION stall, and an empty document gets the
    one tick it could never otherwise produce. It deliberately does NOT touch
    _HB_IDX; no feature is in progress yet, and -1 already means "none".
