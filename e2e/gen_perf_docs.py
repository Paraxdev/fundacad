"""Generate the benchmark documents `e2e/browser_tree_perf.cjs` measures against.

Two documents per size, holding the SAME bodies: one plain (the flat Browser
list) and one carrying an assembly manifest (the nested, collapsed-by-default
tree). Only the manifest differs, so the difference the benchmark measures is
the tree and nothing else.

Run with the sidecar venv, from the repo root:
    sidecar/.venv/bin/python e2e/gen_perf_docs.py
